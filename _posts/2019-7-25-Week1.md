Which user story and server-side functionality will you focus on developing code for in Week #2?  Explain.
What concepts can you research in order to assist you in developing this server-side requirement?  Explain.

1) The user story I will be focusing on this week will be connecting and reading from the database. Concepts I can research would be MERN Stack for starters. Because my application is a React app, I will be using MySql, Express and Node.js.

2) A major advantage for using LAMP would be that it is more customizable, such as changing Apache for NGINX or replacing MySql for PostgreSQL. A major a advantage of using a MERN stack would be that it is all in JavaScript, so it becomes easier and faster to develop an app.

The advantages relate to the current development because my application is a MERN stack. I get to write the code all in JavaScript.
